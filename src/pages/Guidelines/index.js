          <p className="pt-5x">
            Contributions should focus on meaningful code changes, such as bug fixes, new features, or improvements,
            rather than superficial alterations or cosmetic modifications.

          <p className="pt-5x">
            Stress the importance of making contributions that provide clear value to the open-source project and its

          <p className="pt-5x">
            The emphasis on quality has resulted in participants submitting fewer, but more substantial, PRs. This
            approach ensures that contributions are valuable to the open-source community.

            The code review process will be conducted after the event's completion to maintain the quality of
            contributions.

            Experienced reviewers will provide valuable feedback, enhancing the overall quality of PRs. The rejection of
            low-quality PRs will reinforce the importance of quality contributions, and participants will become more
            conscious of submitting meaningful changes.

            This approach ensures that the final report for <strong>Frogtoberfest</strong> reflects the true value of
